An Adaptive Correspondence Algorithm for Modeling Scenes with Strong Interreflections,"Yi Xu;
Daniel G. Aliaga",IEEE,Year: 2009,"Abstract:
Modeling real-world scenes, beyond diffuse objects, plays an important role in computer graphics, virtual reality, and other commercial applications. One active approach is projecting binary patterns in order to obtain correspondence and reconstruct a densely sampled 3D model. In such structured-light systems, determining whether a pixel is directly illuminated by the projector is essential to decoding the patterns. When a scene has abundant indirect light, this process is especially difficult. In this paper, we present a robust pixel classification algorithm for this purpose. Our method correctly establishes the lower and upper bounds of the possible intensity values of an illuminated pixel and of a non-illuminated pixel. Based on the two intervals, our method classifies a pixel by determining whether its intensity is within one interval but not in the other. Our method performs better than standard method due to the fact that it avoids gross errors during decoding process caused by strong inter-reflections. For the remaining uncertain pixels, we apply an iterative algorithm to reduce the inter-reflection within the scene. Thus, more points can be decoded and reconstructed after each iteration. Moreover, the iterative algorithm is carried out in an adaptive fashion for fast convergence.",IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"Volume: 15, | Issue: 3",Papers (32)
Dual Poisson-Disk Tiling: An Efficient Method for Distributing Features on Arbitrary Surfaces,"Hongwei Li;
Kui-Yip Lo;
Man-Kang Leung;
Chi-Wing Fu",IEEE,Year: 2008,"Abstract:
This paper introduces a novel surface-modeling method to stochastically distribute features on arbitrary topological surfaces. The generated distribution of features follows the Poisson disk distribution, so we can have a minimum separation guarantee between features and avoid feature overlap. With the proposed method, we not only can interactively adjust and edit features with the help of the proposed Poisson disk map, but can also efficiently re-distribute features on object surfaces. The underlying mechanism is our dual tiling scheme, known as the Dual Poisson-Disk Tiling. First, we compute the dual of a given surface parameterization, and tile the dual surface by our specially-designed dual tiles; during the pre-processing, the Poisson disk distribution has been pre-generated on these tiles. By dual tiling, we can nicely avoid the problem of corner heterogeneity when tiling arbitrary parameterized surfaces, and can also reduce the tile set complexity. Furthermore, the dual tiling scheme is non-periodic, and we can also maintain a manageable tile set. To demonstrate the applicability of this technique, we explore a number of surface-modeling applications: pattern and shape distribution, bump-mapping, illustrative rendering, mold simulation, the modeling of separable features in texture and BTF, and the distribution of geometric textures in shell space.",IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"Volume: 14, | Issue: 5",Papers (16)

Feng Luo",IEEE,Year: 2013,"Abstract:
We present a novel area-preservation mapping/flattening method using the optimal mass transport technique, based on the Monge-Brenier theory. Our optimal transport map approach is rigorous and solid in theory, efficient and parallel in computation, yet general for various applications. By comparison with the conventional Monge-Kantorovich approach, our method reduces the number of variables from O(n2) to O(n), and converts the optimal mass transport problem to a convex optimization problem, which can now be efficiently carried out by Newton's method. Furthermore, our framework includes the area weighting strategy that enables users to completely control and adjust the size of areas everywhere in an accurate and quantitative way. Our method significantly reduces the complexity of the problem, and improves the efficiency, flexibility and scalability during visualization. Our framework, by combining conformal mapping and optimal mass transport mapping, serves as a powerful tool for a broad range of applications in visualization and graphics, especially for medical imaging. We provide a variety of experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency, robustness and efficacy of our novel framework.",IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"Volume: 19, | Issue: 12",Papers (69)
Camera-sampling field and its applications,"Ping-Hsien Lin;
Tong-Yee Lee",IEEE,Year: 2004,"Abstract:
We propose a novel vector field, called a camera-sampling field, to represent the sampling density distribution of a pinhole camera. We give the derivation and discuss some essential properties of the camera-sampling field, including flux, divergence, curl, gradient, level surface, and sampling patterns. This vector field reveals camera-sampling concisely and facilitates camera sampling analysis. The usage for this vector field in several computer graphics applications is introduced, such as determining the splat kernel for image-based rendering, texture filtering, mipmap level selection, level transition criteria for LOD, and LDI-construction.",IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"Volume: 10, | Issue: 3",Papers (2)
GPU-Assisted Computation of Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation,"Guodong Rong;

Xiaohu Guo",IEEE,Year: 2011,"Abstract:
Centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVT) are widely used in computational science and engineering. The most commonly used method is Lloyd's method, and recently the L-BFGS method is shown to be faster than Lloyd's method for computing the CVT. However, these methods run on the CPU and are still too slow for many practical applications. We present techniques to implement these methods on the GPU for computing the CVT on 2D planes and on surfaces, and demonstrate significant speedup of these GPU-based methods over their CPU counterparts. For CVT computation on a surface, we use a geometry image stored in the GPU to represent the surface for computing the Voronoi diagram on it. In our implementation a new technique is proposed for parallel regional reduction on the GPU for evaluating integrals over Voronoi cells.",IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"Volume: 17, | Issue: 3",Papers (49)
Diffusion Equations over Arbitrary Triangulated Surfaces for Filtering and Texture Applications,"Chunlin Wu;
Jiansong Deng;
Falai Chen",IEEE,Year: 2008,"Abstract:
In computer graphics, triangular mesh representations of surfaces have become very popular. Compared with parametric and implicit forms of surfaces, triangular mesh surfaces have many advantages such as being easy to render, being convenient to store, and having the ability to model geometric objects with arbitrary topology. In this paper, we are interested in data processing over triangular mesh surfaces through partial differential equations (PDEs). We study several diffusion equations over triangular mesh surfaces and present corresponding numerical schemes to solve them. Our methods work for triangular mesh surfaces with arbitrary geometry (the angles of each triangle are arbitrary) and topology (open meshes or closed meshes of arbitrary genus). Besides the flexibility, our methods are efficient due to the implicit/semi-implicit time discretization. We finally apply our methods to several filtering and texture applications such as image processing, texture generation, and regularization of harmonic maps over triangular mesh surfaces. The results demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our methods.",IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"Volume: 14, | Issue: 3",Papers (9)
Constraint Fluids,"Kenneth Bodin;
Claude Lacoursiere;
Martin Servin",IEEE,Year: 2012,"Abstract:
We present a fluid simulation method based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) in which incompressibility and boundary conditions are enforced using holonomic kinematic constraints on the density. This formulation enables systematic multiphysics integration in which interactions are modeled via similar constraints between the fluid pseudoparticles and impenetrable surfaces of other bodies. These conditions embody Archimede's principle for solids and thus buoyancy results as a direct consequence. We use a variational time stepping scheme suitable for general constrained multibody systems we call SPOOK. Each step requires the solution of only one Mixed Linear Complementarity Problem (MLCP) with very few inequalities, corresponding to solid boundary conditions. We solve this MLCP with a fast iterative method. Overall stability is vastly improved in comparison to the unconstrained version of SPH, and this allows much larger time steps, and an increase in overall performance by two orders of magnitude. Proof of concept is given for computer graphics applications and interactive simulations.",IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"Volume: 18, | Issue: 3",Papers (48)
Noise-resistant fitting for spherical harmonics,"Ping-Man Lam;
Chi-Sing Leung;
Tien-Tsin Wong",IEEE,Year: 2006,"Abstract:
Spherical harmonic (SH) basis functions have been widely used for representing spherical functions in modeling various illumination properties. They can compactly represent low-frequency spherical functions. However, when the unconstrained least square method is used for estimating the SH coefficients of a hemispherical function, the magnitude of these SH coefficients could be very large. Hence, the rendering result is very sensitive to quantization noise (introduced by modern texture compression like S3TC, IEEE half float data type on GPU, or other lossy compression methods) in these SH coefficients. Our experiments show that, as the precision of SH coefficients are reduced, the rendered images may exhibit annoying visual artifacts. To reduce the noise sensitivity of the SH coefficients, this paper first discusses how the magnitude of SH coefficients affects the rendering result when there is quantization noise. Then, two fast fitting methods for estimating the noise-resistant SH coefficients are proposed. They can effectively control the magnitude of the estimated SH coefficients and, hence, suppress the rendering artifacts. Both statistical and visual results confirm our theory.",IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"Volume: 12, | Issue: 2",Papers (17)

Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW),Kjeld Schmidt,SPRINGER,2024,"Bibliographical formalities The CSCW Journal has moved to the Chicago Author-Date format standard for citations and references. The journal has since its launch some 30 years ago been using a house format. The house format was devised and adopted because it, for a journal that should be a venue for scholars from very different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds, was important that the bibliographic information should be unambiguous and accessible to a heterogeneous readership, and because the common bibliographic standards left out much information and their use thus might give rise to ambiguities and hamper access to sources. However, with the widespread adoption of the DOI standard for publication IDs, the risk of ambiguity and disorientation has been seriously reduced. On that background, there is no longer any serious reason to require of authors that they use a bibliographic format that to many might seem esoteric and for which there are no standard templates. We trust our authors will appreciate this transition. Myriam Lewkowicz and Kjeld Schmidt Editors-in-Chief --------- Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW): The Journal of Collaborative Computing and Work Practices is devoted to innovative research in computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). It provides an interdisciplinary and international forum for the debate and exchange of ideas concerning theoretical, practical, technical, and social issues in CSCW. The CSCW Journal encourages contributions that are mindful of the relations between social-science studies of cooperative work practices and their requirements with respect to computing technology. For example, we would urge social scientists who have made a study of a workgroup to spell out clearly what the implications of their findings are for design of appropriate computer support. Equally, we would urge computer scientists reporting on a technological innovation in, say, meeting room support, to spell out clearly how this work is motivated by studies of meetings or what new studies of meetings it suggests. What is required, is that contributions to the CSCW Journal have visible implications for CSCW: implications for the development of practice-oriented computing technologies.",Journal,N/A,N/A
